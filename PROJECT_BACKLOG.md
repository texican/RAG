## Task Execution Guidelines

**For Claude Code instances executing these tasks:**

1. **Start with Context**: Read CLAUDE.md file to understand current project state
2. **Check Dependencies**: Ensure prerequisite tasks are completed before starting
3. **Follow TDD**: Write tests first, then implement functionality
4. **Update Documentation**: Update CLAUDE.md with progress and any important discoveries
5. **Code Quality**: Address any IDE issues that arise during development
6. **Commit Properly**: Use source-control-manager agent for all git operations
7. **Validate Completion**: Ensure all acceptance criteria are met before marking complete

## Task Execution Summary

### **Story Point Distribution After Anchoring:**
- **Total Tasks**: 72 tasks (vs 23 original "boulders")
- **Pebbles (1-3 points)**: 68 tasks - Small, focused work (1-2 days each)
- **Rocks (5-8 points)**: 4 legacy tasks - Will be broken down in future iterations
- **Boulders (13+ points)**: 0 tasks - All large epics properly decomposed

### **Benefits of Anchoring Methodology:**
1. **Sprint Planning**: Each service area now has 4-6 related tasks forming natural sprints
2. **Team Swarming**: Small tasks enable multiple developers to collaborate effectively  
3. **Predictable Velocity**: 2-3 point tasks provide consistent estimation accuracy
4. **Reduced Risk**: Small tasks minimize integration complexity and delivery risk
5. **Faster Feedback**: Quick task completion enables rapid iteration and course correction

### **Execution Timeline:**
- **High Priority (Week 1-2):** Docker system stability and basic integration testing
- **Medium Priority (Week 2-4):** Production readiness, testing standards, and quality gates
- **Low Priority (Week 4-6+):** Advanced features, monitoring, and enterprise enhancements

### **Task Independence:**
All tasks are designed to be completely independent within their dependency chains, enabling:
- **Parallel execution** by multiple Claude Code instances
- **Flexible prioritization** based on changing business needs
- **Risk mitigation** through independent validation of each component

This anchoring approach transforms unwieldy "boulder" epics into manageable "pebble" tasks that follow industry best practices for agile story sizing and team productivity.
