## Task Execution Guidelines

**For Claude Code instances executing these tasks:**

1. **Start with Context**: Read CLAUDE.md file to understand current project state
2. **Check Dependencies**: Ensure prerequisite tasks are completed before starting
3. **Follow TDD**: Write tests first, then implement functionality
4. **Update Documentation**: Update CLAUDE.md with progress and any important discoveries
5. **Code Quality**: Address any IDE issues that arise during development
6. **Commit Properly**: Use source-control-manager agent for all git operations
7. **Validate Completion**: Ensure all acceptance criteria are met before marking complete

**Estimated Timeline:**
- **High Priority (Week 1-2):** Core system stability and basic functionality
- **Medium Priority (Week 2-3):** Production readiness and advanced features  
- **Low Priority (Week 3-4+):** Enterprise enhancements and optimizations

Each task is designed to be completely independent and can be worked on by different Claude Code instances simultaneously.
