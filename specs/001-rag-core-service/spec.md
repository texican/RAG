# Feature Specification: RAG Core Service

**Feature Branch**: `001-rag-core-service`  
**Created**: 2025-09-18  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "rag-core-service"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Feature name extracted: RAG Core Service
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identified: RAG orchestration, query processing, LLM integration, document retrieval
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ All core capabilities identified from existing implementation
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ Clear user flows for query processing and multi-turn conversations
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement mapped to existing service capabilities
6. Identify Key Entities
   ’ Query, Response, Conversation, Document entities identified
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present
   ’ No implementation details included
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a business user, I need to ask questions about documents and receive accurate, contextual answers so that I can quickly find relevant information from our knowledge base without manually searching through multiple documents.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has uploaded documents to their tenant space, **When** they submit a natural language query, **Then** the system retrieves relevant document chunks and generates a comprehensive answer with source citations
2. **Given** a user is engaged in a multi-turn conversation, **When** they ask a follow-up question, **Then** the system maintains conversation context and provides answers that reference previous exchanges
3. **Given** a user submits a query with no relevant documents, **When** the system processes the request, **Then** it returns a clear message indicating no relevant information was found
4. **Given** multiple users from different tenants submit queries simultaneously, **When** the system processes these requests, **Then** each user receives responses based only on their tenant's documents with complete data isolation
5. **Given** a user requests a streaming response, **When** the system generates an answer, **Then** response chunks are delivered in real-time for immediate user feedback

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user submits an empty or very short query?
- How does the system handle queries in languages not supported by the underlying language models?
- What occurs when the document corpus is extremely large and retrieval takes longer than expected?
- How does the system behave when the language model service is temporarily unavailable?
- What happens when a user tries to access conversation history that doesn't exist?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST process natural language queries and return relevant answers within 30 seconds for standard queries
- **FR-002**: System MUST retrieve and rank document chunks based on semantic similarity to user queries
- **FR-003**: System MUST generate responses using large language models while citing specific source documents
- **FR-004**: System MUST maintain conversation history for multi-turn dialogues within user sessions
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide tenant isolation ensuring users only access their organization's documents
- **FR-006**: System MUST support streaming responses for real-time user experience during answer generation
- **FR-007**: System MUST cache frequently requested query responses to improve performance
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide detailed metrics including response times, document relevance scores, and token usage
- **FR-009**: System MUST integrate with document and embedding services to retrieve contextual information
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle asynchronous query processing for complex or long-running requests
- **FR-011**: System MUST optimize queries to improve retrieval accuracy and response quality
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide health monitoring endpoints for service availability verification
- **FR-013**: System MUST support multiple language model providers with configurable selection
- **FR-014**: System MUST validate tenant authorization before processing any queries
- **FR-015**: System MUST maintain audit logs of all query processing activities for compliance

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Query**: Represents user questions with associated metadata including tenant context, conversation ID, and processing options
- **Response**: Contains generated answers with source citations, relevance metrics, and processing metadata
- **Conversation**: Maintains multi-turn dialogue history with context preservation for follow-up questions
- **Document Chunk**: Represents retrieved text segments with relevance scores and source document metadata
- **Processing Metrics**: Captures performance data including retrieval times, generation latency, and resource utilization
- **Cache Entry**: Stores frequently accessed query-response pairs for performance optimization
- **Tenant Context**: Ensures secure data isolation and access control for multi-tenant operations
