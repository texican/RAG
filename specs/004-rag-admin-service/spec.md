**Created**: 2025-09-20  
**Status**: Implementation Complete (Documentation)  
**Input**: User description: "/specify rag-admin-service"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Feature: RAG Admin Service for enterprise multi-tenant administration
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identified: system administrators, tenant management, user administration, authentication, monitoring
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ All aspects clear from existing implementation analysis
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ Admin workflows for tenant and user management defined
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ All requirements testable and based on existing implementation
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ’ Entities: Tenant, User, Admin, Audit Log, System Metrics
7. Run Review Checklist

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
System administrators need a centralized administrative interface to manage multiple tenant organizations and their users in the Enterprise RAG system. Administrators must be able to create new tenant organizations, manage existing tenants, oversee user accounts across all tenants, and monitor system health and performance.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a system administrator has valid credentials, **When** they log into the admin portal, **Then** they receive secure authentication with appropriate administrative privileges
2. **Given** an administrator wants to onboard a new organization, **When** they create a new tenant with organization details, **Then** the system provisions an isolated tenant workspace with initial configuration
3. **Given** an administrator needs to manage tenant operations, **When** they update tenant settings or suspend/reactivate tenants, **Then** the changes take effect immediately with proper audit logging
4. **Given** an administrator oversees user management, **When** they view user accounts across tenants, **Then** they can see user status, roles, and tenant associations
5. **Given** an administrator monitors system health, **When** they access system metrics and logs, **Then** they receive real-time operational data and audit trails

### Edge Cases
- What happens when an administrator attempts to delete a tenant with active users and documents?
- How does the system handle simultaneous tenant management operations by multiple administrators?
- What occurs when tenant resource limits are exceeded or need adjustment?
- How does the system respond to authentication failures or security incidents?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide secure authentication for administrative users with role-based access control
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow administrators to create new tenant organizations with unique identifiers and configuration
- **FR-003**: System MUST enable administrators to view, update, suspend, and reactivate tenant organizations
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide paginated listing of all tenants with sorting and filtering capabilities
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow administrators to manage user accounts across all tenant organizations
- **FR-006**: System MUST validate administrator credentials and maintain secure session management
- **FR-007**: System MUST log all administrative actions for audit and compliance purposes
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide system health monitoring and performance metrics
- **FR-009**: System MUST enforce tenant isolation to prevent data leakage between organizations
- **FR-010**: System MUST allow administrators to configure tenant resource limits and quotas
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide secure logout functionality with session termination
- **FR-012**: System MUST validate all administrative operations against business rules and constraints

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Tenant**: Represents an isolated organizational unit with name, unique identifier, status, resource limits, and associated users and documents
- **User**: Represents individual users within tenants with roles, status, authentication details, and tenant association
- **Admin**: Represents system administrators with elevated privileges for cross-tenant management operations
- **Audit Log**: Represents administrative action records with timestamps, user identification, and operation details for compliance
- **System Metrics**: Represents operational data including performance indicators, resource usage, and health status
