# Tasks: RAG Admin Service Documentation

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/004-rag-admin-service/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (complete), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → Implementation plan found: Complete Java 17 + Spring Boot microservice
   → Extract: Spring Boot 3.x, PostgreSQL, Redis, JWT, Docker
2. Load optional design documents:
   → data-model.md: Extract entities → documentation tasks
   → contracts/: Each API file → contract documentation task
   → research.md: Extract decisions → setup documentation tasks
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: Project analysis, documentation setup
   → Documentation: API contracts, data models, operational guides
   → Analysis: Architecture review, security assessment, test coverage
   → Enhancement Planning: Performance optimization, future improvements
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Analysis before documentation before planning
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness:
   → All endpoints have API documentation?
   → All entities have model documentation?
   → All features have operational guides?
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Single project**: Documentation in `specs/004-rag-admin-service/`
- **Source analysis**: Existing implementation at repository root
- Paths shown below assume single microservice project structure

## Phase 3.1: Setup & Analysis
- [ ] T001 Analyze existing project structure and Spring Boot configuration
- [ ] T002 [P] Document current JWT authentication implementation patterns
- [ ] T003 [P] Analyze PostgreSQL database schema and entity relationships
- [ ] T004 [P] Review Redis session management and caching strategy
- [ ] T005 [P] Assess existing test coverage with TestContainers integration

## Phase 3.2: API Documentation (Documentation First)
**CRITICAL: Document existing API behavior before enhancement planning**
- [ ] T006 [P] Document authentication endpoints in contracts/auth-api.yml
- [ ] T007 [P] Document tenant management endpoints in contracts/tenant-api.yml
- [ ] T008 [P] Document user administration endpoints in contracts/user-api.yml
- [ ] T009 [P] Document system monitoring endpoints in contracts/system-api.yml
- [ ] T010 [P] Create consolidated OpenAPI specification in contracts/admin-service-api.yml

## Phase 3.3: Data Model Documentation
- [ ] T011 [P] Document Tenant entity model in data-model.md (tenant section)
- [ ] T012 [P] Document User entity model in data-model.md (user section)
- [ ] T013 [P] Document Admin entity model in data-model.md (admin section)
- [ ] T014 [P] Document Audit Log entity model in data-model.md (audit section)
- [ ] T015 Document entity relationships and multi-tenant isolation in data-model.md
- [ ] T016 Document database constraints and validation rules in data-model.md

## Phase 3.4: Operational Documentation
- [ ] T017 Create comprehensive quickstart guide in quickstart.md
- [ ] T018 [P] Document Docker containerization setup and configuration
- [ ] T019 [P] Document Prometheus metrics integration and monitoring setup
- [ ] T020 [P] Document security implementation (JWT, CORS, multi-tenant isolation)
- [ ] T021 Document troubleshooting guide and common operational scenarios

## Phase 3.5: Security & Performance Analysis
- [ ] T022 [P] Conduct security assessment of JWT implementation in security-analysis.md
- [ ] T023 [P] Analyze multi-tenant data isolation patterns in security-analysis.md
- [ ] T024 [P] Review authentication and authorization flows in security-analysis.md
- [ ] T025 Performance analysis of current implementation (<200ms p95 goal)
- [ ] T026 [P] Assess scalability for 100+ tenants and 10k+ users
- [ ] T027 [P] Document current observability and logging patterns

## Phase 3.6: Enhancement Planning
- [ ] T028 [P] Identify API optimization opportunities in enhancement-plan.md
- [ ] T029 [P] Plan database performance improvements in enhancement-plan.md
- [ ] T030 [P] Design caching strategy enhancements in enhancement-plan.md
- [ ] T031 Plan monitoring and alerting improvements
- [ ] T032 [P] Document future feature expansion possibilities
- [ ] T033 Create implementation roadmap for identified enhancements

## Dependencies
- Analysis (T001-T005) before documentation (T006-T016)
- T015 depends on T011-T014 (entity relationships after individual entities)
- T016 depends on T015 (constraints after relationships)
- T017 depends on T006-T010 (quickstart after API documentation)
- Enhancement planning (T028-T033) depends on all analysis and documentation

## Parallel Example
```
# Launch T006-T009 together (API documentation):
Task: "Document authentication endpoints in contracts/auth-api.yml"
Task: "Document tenant management endpoints in contracts/tenant-api.yml"
Task: "Document user administration endpoints in contracts/user-api.yml"
Task: "Document system monitoring endpoints in contracts/system-api.yml"

# Launch T011-T014 together (entity documentation):
Task: "Document Tenant entity model in data-model.md (tenant section)"
Task: "Document User entity model in data-model.md (user section)"
Task: "Document Admin entity model in data-model.md (admin section)"
Task: "Document Audit Log entity model in data-model.md (audit section)"
```

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files or independent sections, no dependencies
- Focus on documenting existing implementation behavior
- Analyze current architecture before planning enhancements
- Commit after each task completion
- Avoid: vague documentation, overlapping file modifications

## Task Generation Rules
*Applied during main() execution*

1. **From Existing Implementation**:
   - Each API endpoint → documentation task [P]
   - Each entity → model documentation task [P]
   
2. **From Technical Context**:
   - Each technology stack component → analysis task [P]
   - Each architectural pattern → documentation task
   
3. **From User Stories**:
   - Each admin workflow → operational guide section
   - Each monitoring requirement → observability documentation

4. **Ordering**:
   - Analysis → Documentation → Enhancement Planning
   - Dependencies block parallel execution

## Validation Checklist
*GATE: Checked by main() before returning*

- [x] All API endpoints have corresponding documentation tasks
- [x] All entities have model documentation tasks
- [x] All analysis comes before documentation
- [x] Parallel tasks truly independent (different files/sections)
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path or section
- [x] No task modifies same file section as another [P] task
- [x] Enhancement planning follows analysis and documentation
- [x] Operational guides cover all admin workflows
