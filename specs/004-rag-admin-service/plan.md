# Implementation Plan: RAG Admin Service

**Branch**: `004-rag-admin-service` | **Date**: 2025-09-20 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/004-rag-admin-service/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → Spec found: Complete feature specification for admin service
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Technical context documented from existing implementation
   → Set Structure Decision: Single microservice project
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → No violations detected in existing implementation
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → Documentation-focused research for existing implementation
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, CLAUDE.md
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → No new violations expected in documentation phase
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe documentation task generation approach
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
RAG Admin Service is a complete, production-ready microservice providing enterprise multi-tenant administration capabilities. The primary requirement is to document the existing architecture, create API contracts, and establish a comprehensive documentation workflow for the implemented authentication endpoints, tenant management, user administration, and system monitoring features.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Java 17  
**Primary Dependencies**: Spring Boot 3.x, Spring Security, Spring Data JPA  
**Storage**: PostgreSQL (primary), Redis (caching/sessions)  
**Testing**: JUnit 5, Spring Boot Test, TestContainers  
**Target Platform**: Linux server, Docker containerized  
**Project Type**: single - determines source structure  
**Performance Goals**: 1000 req/s, <200ms p95 response time  
**Constraints**: <200ms p95, JWT-based authentication, multi-tenant isolation  
**Scale/Scope**: 100+ tenants, 10k+ users, 24/7 availability

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Status**: PASS - No constitutional violations detected
- Existing implementation follows single-service architecture
- Test coverage is comprehensive (unit, integration, contract tests)
- Authentication and authorization properly implemented
- Multi-tenant isolation enforced at data layer
- Observability through Prometheus metrics and structured logging

**Structure Decision**: Option 1 - Single microservice project

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - Document existing JWT implementation patterns
   - Research Spring Boot 3.x multi-tenant best practices
   - Document Redis session management approach
   - Research Docker containerization patterns for Spring Boot

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   Task: "Document JWT authentication implementation for Spring Boot 3.x admin service"
   Task: "Research multi-tenant data isolation patterns in Spring Data JPA"
   Task: "Document Redis session management best practices for admin services"
   Task: "Research Prometheus metrics integration patterns for Spring Boot microservices"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was implemented]
   - Rationale: [why this approach was chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what other options were evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with architecture decisions documented

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Tenant entity with fields, relationships, validation rules
   - User entity with authentication details, roles, tenant associations
   - Admin entity with elevated privileges and audit trail
   - Audit Log entity with compliance tracking
   - System Metrics entity with operational data

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - Authentication endpoints: POST /admin/auth/login, POST /admin/auth/logout
   - Tenant management: GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /admin/tenants/*
   - User administration: GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /admin/users/*
   - System monitoring: GET /admin/system/health, GET /admin/system/metrics
   - Output OpenAPI schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - Authentication contract tests (login/logout flows)
   - Tenant CRUD operation tests
   - User management operation tests
   - System monitoring endpoint tests
   - Tests document existing behavior rather than failing tests

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Admin authentication and session management scenarios
   - Tenant lifecycle management scenarios
   - Cross-tenant user administration scenarios
   - System health monitoring scenarios

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude`
   - Add Spring Boot 3.x, PostgreSQL, Redis, JWT context
   - Preserve existing manual additions
   - Update with rag-admin-service implementation details
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root as CLAUDE.md

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, contract tests, quickstart.md, CLAUDE.md

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate documentation tasks from existing implementation
- Each API endpoint → contract documentation task [P]
- Each entity → data model documentation task [P] 
- Each user story → integration test documentation task
- Quickstart guide creation and validation tasks

**Ordering Strategy**:
- Documentation-first order: Contracts before data models before guides
- Dependency order: Core entities before relationships before workflows
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent documentation files)

**Estimated Output**: 15-20 numbered, ordered documentation tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Documentation implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run contract tests, execute quickstart.md, documentation review)

## Complexity Tracking
*No constitutional violations detected - section left empty*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| N/A | N/A | N/A |
