# Feature Specification: RAG Gateway

**Feature Branch**: `003-rag-gateway`  
**Created**: 2025-09-19  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "rag-gateway"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identified: API gateway, request routing, authentication, rate limiting
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific authentication requirements and session management]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ Primary flow: Client requests through gateway to microservices
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement must be testable
   ’ Security, routing, and performance requirements identified
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ’ Gateway routes, authentication tokens, rate limit records
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ’ If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a client application, I need a unified entry point to access all RAG system microservices (auth, document, embedding, core) through a single gateway that handles authentication, routing, rate limiting, and security validation, so that I can interact with the RAG system without managing multiple service endpoints directly.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a valid authenticated client, **When** making a request to any RAG service endpoint, **Then** the gateway routes the request to the appropriate microservice and returns the response
2. **Given** an unauthenticated client, **When** attempting to access protected endpoints, **Then** the gateway returns an authentication error without forwarding the request
3. **Given** a client exceeding rate limits, **When** making additional requests, **Then** the gateway blocks the request and returns a rate limit error
4. **Given** a malformed or invalid request, **When** submitted to the gateway, **Then** the gateway validates and rejects the request before forwarding

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a downstream microservice is unavailable or returns an error?
- How does the system handle concurrent requests that might hit rate limits simultaneously?
- What occurs when authentication tokens expire during a request?
- How are circuit breaker patterns handled for failing services?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a single entry point for all RAG microservice endpoints
- **FR-002**: System MUST authenticate all incoming requests using JWT tokens
- **FR-003**: System MUST route authenticated requests to appropriate downstream services (auth, document, embedding, core)
- **FR-004**: System MUST implement rate limiting per client to prevent abuse
- **FR-005**: System MUST validate request formats and reject malformed requests
- **FR-006**: System MUST log all requests for audit and monitoring purposes
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle service discovery and load balancing for downstream services
- **FR-008**: System MUST implement circuit breaker patterns for resilient service communication
- **FR-009**: System MUST support CORS for web-based client applications
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide health check endpoints for monitoring
- **FR-011**: System MUST implement security headers and request validation [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific security header requirements and validation rules]
- **FR-012**: System MUST handle session management and token refresh [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: session timeout policies and refresh token strategies]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Gateway Route**: Represents routing configuration mapping client endpoints to downstream services
- **Authentication Context**: Contains validated user/client identity and permissions for request processing
- **Rate Limit Record**: Tracks request counts and timing for rate limiting enforcement
- **Circuit Breaker State**: Maintains health status and failure tracking for downstream services
- **Audit Log Entry**: Records request details, timing, and outcomes for monitoring and compliance
