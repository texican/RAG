# Feature Specification: RAG Shared Components

**Feature Branch**: `002-rag-shared`  
**Created**: 2025-09-18  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "rag-shared"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Feature name extracted: RAG Shared Components
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identified: Shared entities, DTOs, utilities, configuration, exception handling
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ All core shared components identified from existing implementation
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ Clear usage patterns for shared components across microservices
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement mapped to existing shared functionality
6. Identify Key Entities
   ’ BaseEntity, Document, DocumentChunk, Tenant, User entities identified
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present
   ’ No implementation details included
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT shared components need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "shared components" without details), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - Component reusability patterns
   - Data consistency requirements
   - Cross-service integration patterns
   - Version compatibility requirements
   - Security and audit requirements

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a microservice developer, I need standardized shared components for entities, DTOs, exceptions, and utilities so that I can maintain consistency across all RAG services, reduce code duplication, and ensure reliable inter-service communication without reimplementing common functionality.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a developer is creating a new microservice, **When** they need to define document entities, **Then** they can extend the shared BaseEntity and use predefined Document entities with consistent audit fields and validation
2. **Given** multiple microservices need to communicate, **When** they exchange data, **Then** they use standardized DTOs that ensure type safety and consistent serialization across service boundaries
3. **Given** a service encounters an error condition, **When** it needs to propagate the error, **Then** it throws standardized RagException types that provide consistent error codes and messages for client applications
4. **Given** a service needs to process text documents, **When** it requires text chunking functionality, **Then** it uses shared text processing utilities that provide configurable chunking strategies
5. **Given** services need database connectivity, **When** they configure JPA repositories, **Then** they inherit shared configuration that ensures consistent database behavior and audit trail tracking

### Edge Cases
- What happens when shared entity schemas need to evolve without breaking existing services?
- How do services handle version mismatches in shared DTOs during rolling deployments?
- What occurs when shared utility methods need to be updated for security vulnerabilities?
- How does the system ensure consistent exception handling across different service implementations?
- What happens when shared configuration conflicts with service-specific requirements?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a BaseEntity class with automatic UUID generation, audit fields, and optimistic locking for all persistent entities
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide standardized entity classes for Document, DocumentChunk, Tenant, and User with comprehensive validation and relationships
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide DTOs for data transfer between services with proper serialization support and validation annotations
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide a hierarchical exception framework with RagException as the base class and specific exception types for different error categories
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide text processing utilities including configurable chunking strategies for document preprocessing
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide security utilities for tenant isolation and access control across all services
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide JSON processing utilities with consistent serialization configurations for inter-service communication
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide JPA configuration that enables auditing, entity scanning, and consistent database behavior
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide repository interfaces with common query patterns and pagination support
- **FR-010**: System MUST ensure all shared components are version-compatible across microservice deployments
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide error response DTOs with standardized structure for consistent API error handling
- **FR-012**: System MUST support multi-tenant data isolation through shared tenant context utilities
- **FR-013**: System MUST provide document processing status tracking with enumerated states and validation
- **FR-014**: System MUST ensure all shared entities include comprehensive metadata for debugging and audit purposes
- **FR-015**: System MUST provide utilities for document chunking with semantic, fixed-size, and sliding window strategies

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **BaseEntity**: Abstract base class providing UUID primary keys, automatic audit fields (created/updated timestamps), version control for optimistic locking, and standard equals/hashCode implementation
- **Document**: Represents uploaded documents with metadata including filename, file path, content type, processing status, extracted text, and tenant relationships
- **DocumentChunk**: Represents text segments from processed documents with content, metadata, embedding vectors, and relationships to parent documents
- **Tenant**: Represents organizational isolation units with configuration settings, usage limits, and security boundaries for multi-tenant architecture
- **User**: Represents system users with authentication details, tenant associations, role assignments, and activity tracking
- **DocumentDto/DocumentChunkDto**: Data transfer objects for cross-service communication with proper serialization and validation
- **ErrorResponse**: Standardized error response structure with error codes, messages, timestamps, and debugging information
- **TenantDto**: Tenant data transfer object with configuration settings and chunking strategy specifications
