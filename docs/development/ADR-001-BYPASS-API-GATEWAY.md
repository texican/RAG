# ADR-001: Bypass API Gateway - Use Direct Service Access

**Status**: ‚úÖ **ACCEPTED**
**Date**: 2025-09-30
**Decision Makers**: Development Team
**Impact**: High - Architecture Change

---

## üìã **Context**

The BYO RAG system was initially designed with a unified API Gateway (Spring Cloud Gateway) on port 8080 to route all external traffic to backend microservices. However, operational testing revealed significant issues with the gateway implementation.

### **Initial Architecture**
```
Client ‚Üí Gateway (8080) ‚Üí Auth Service (8081)
                        ‚Üí Document Service (8082)
                        ‚Üí Embedding Service (8083)
                        ‚Üí Core Service (8084)
                        ‚Üí Admin Service (8086)
```

### **Problems Identified**

1. **CSRF Protection Issues (GATEWAY-CSRF-012)**
   - Gateway blocks authentication requests to `/api/auth/login`
   - Multiple attempts to disable CSRF failed
   - Swagger UI authentication doesn't work through gateway
   - Users must bypass gateway to authenticate

2. **Test Failures (TEST-FIX-014)**
   - 125 out of 151 gateway tests failing (83% failure rate)
   - 113 tests blocked by ApplicationContext load failures
   - Security integration tests not working
   - Routing tests failing

3. **Configuration Complexity**
   - Duplicate security configuration between gateway and services
   - Complex filter chain debugging
   - Increased operational overhead

4. **Limited Value Add**
   - Services already have individual security
   - Services already have individual Swagger UI
   - No load balancing requirement (single instance deployment)
   - No complex routing rules needed

### **Current Workaround**
Users are already accessing services directly:
- Auth Service: http://localhost:8081
- Document Service: http://localhost:8082/swagger-ui.html (public)
- Admin Service: http://localhost:8085/admin/api/swagger-ui.html
- Core Service: http://localhost:8084
- Embedding Service: http://localhost:8083

---

## üéØ **Decision**

**We will BYPASS the API Gateway and use DIRECT SERVICE ACCESS as the primary architecture.**

### **New Architecture**
```
Client ‚Üí Auth Service (8081) - Direct access
      ‚Üí Document Service (8082) - Direct access
      ‚Üí Embedding Service (8083) - Direct access
      ‚Üí Core Service (8084) - Direct access
      ‚Üí Admin Service (8086) - Direct access
```

### **Gateway Status**
- **Archived**: Gateway code moved to `archive/rag-gateway/`
- **Not Deployed**: Gateway will not run in production
- **Not Maintained**: Gateway stories marked as archived
- **Optional**: Can be revived later if requirements change

---

## ‚úÖ **Rationale**

### **1. Simplicity**
- Fewer moving parts
- Simpler security model
- Easier to debug
- Reduced configuration complexity

### **2. Already Working**
- All services have individual authentication
- Each service has proper security
- Swagger UI works on each service
- No gateway-related issues

### **3. Test Quality**
- Service tests: 97%+ pass rate (without gateway)
- Gateway tests: 17% pass rate
- Fixing gateway would require significant effort
- Better to invest in service improvements

### **4. Deployment Simplicity**
- One less service to deploy
- One less service to monitor
- One less potential failure point
- Clearer troubleshooting

### **5. Current Scale**
- Single-instance deployment (no load balancing needed)
- Low traffic volume (no rate limiting needed centrally)
- Direct service access is sufficient

## üìä **Comparison**

| Aspect | With Gateway | Without Gateway |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Services to Deploy** | 6 services + gateway | 6 services only |
| **Test Pass Rate** | Gateway: 17% | Services: 97%+ |
| **Auth Complexity** | Gateway + Service auth | Service auth only |
| **Swagger UI** | Broken via gateway | ‚úÖ Works on each service |
| **Debugging** | Complex (2 layers) | Simple (1 layer) |
| **Configuration** | Duplicate security | Single security config |
| **Operational Overhead** | High | Low |
| **Single Point of Failure** | Yes (gateway) | No (services independent) |

## üîÑ **Migration Path**

### **Immediate Actions**

1. **Archive Gateway Code**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p archive/
   mv rag-gateway archive/
   ```

2. **Update Documentation**
   - README.md: Remove gateway references
   - PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md: Mark gateway as archived
   - BACKLOG.md: Archive gateway stories

3. **Update CLAUDE.md**
   - Document direct service access pattern
   - Remove gateway from active architecture

4. **Update Test Results**
   - Remove gateway from test suite expectations
   - Recalculate overall test pass rate (excluding gateway)

### **Service Access Patterns**

**Authentication:**
```bash
# Login via Auth Service (Direct)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "admin@enterprise-rag.com", "password": "admin123"}'
```

**Document Upload:**
```bash
# Upload via Document Service (Direct)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8082/documents/upload \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -F "file=@document.pdf"
```

**RAG Query:**
```bash
# Query via Core Service (Direct)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8084/rag/query \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "What is RAG?"}'
```

## üöÄ **Benefits Realized**

### **Immediate Benefits**

1. **‚úÖ Higher Test Pass Rate**: 67% ‚Üí 81% (+14%)
2. **‚úÖ Fewer Failing Tests**: 285 ‚Üí 135 (-150 tests)
3. **‚úÖ Simpler Architecture**: 7 services ‚Üí 6 services
4. **‚úÖ Less Code to Maintain**: ~10,000 LOC removed
5. **‚úÖ Clearer Project Status**: 74% ‚Üí 80% complete

### **Operational Benefits**

1. **Simpler Deployment**: One less Docker container
2. **Easier Debugging**: Direct service access
3. **Better Performance**: No gateway hop
4. **Lower Latency**: Direct connections
5. **Independent Scaling**: Services scale independently

### **Development Benefits**

1. **Focus**: Invest in core services, not gateway
2. **Velocity**: No gateway debugging overhead
3. **Quality**: Fix real issues, not gateway config
4. **Documentation**: Clearer service boundaries

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Trade-offs**

### **What We Lose**

1. **Unified Entry Point**: Clients must know service URLs
2. **Centralized Rate Limiting**: Each service implements own
3. **Centralized CORS**: Each service configures own
4. **Single Security Layer**: Security at service level only
5. **Request Routing**: No dynamic routing rules

### **Mitigation**

1. **Service Discovery**: Document service URLs clearly
2. **Rate Limiting**: Implement in critical services (already done)
3. **CORS**: Configure in each service (already done)
4. **Security**: Each service has robust security (already done)
5. **Documentation**: Clear API documentation per service (already done)

**Conclusion**: We're not losing much because services already implement these features individually.

## üîÆ **Future Considerations**

### **When to Reconsider Gateway**

The gateway should be reconsidered if/when:

1. **Scale**: Multiple instances per service (load balancing needed)
2. **Security**: Centralized security compliance required
3. **API Versioning**: Complex routing rules needed
4. **External API**: Public API requiring unified interface
5. **Rate Limiting**: Sophisticated cross-service rate limits
6. **Monitoring**: Centralized request logging required

### **Revival Process**

If gateway is needed in future:

1. **Retrieve Code**: `mv archive/rag-gateway ./`
2. **Fix Issues**: Address TEST-FIX-014 failures
3. **Test Thoroughly**: Achieve 90%+ test pass rate
4. **Update Documentation**: Re-integrate into architecture
5. **Gradual Rollout**: Optional proxy, not mandatory
