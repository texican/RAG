# Development Methodology

## Story Point Anchoring Method

This project follows industry-standard story point anchoring to ensure consistent task sizing and realistic sprint planning.

### Task Sizing Philosophy

Following industry-standard story point anchoring:

- **Pebbles (1-3 points)**: Small, focused tasks (1-2 days)
- **Rocks (5-8 points)**: Medium anchor stories (3-5 days) 
- **Boulders (13+ points)**: Large epics requiring breakdown

### Story Point Distribution Guidelines

- **Pebbles (1-3 points)**: Small, focused work (1-2 days each)  
- **Rocks (5-8 points)**: Medium anchor stories (3-5 days each)
- **Boulders (13+ points)**: Large epics requiring careful breakdown

### Benefits of Anchoring Methodology

This anchoring approach transforms unwieldy "boulder" epics into manageable "pebble" tasks that follow industry best practices for agile story sizing and team productivity.

### TODO-Based Story Integration

The methodology supports automatic story generation from TODO comments in the codebase, ensuring development tasks are captured and sized appropriately in the project backlog.

### Implementation Standards

- All tasks should be broken down to avoid boulders where possible
- Epic-level work (13+ points) requires detailed breakdown into smaller stories
- Regular backlog grooming to maintain appropriate sizing distribution
- Story points reflect complexity, not time estimation

## Completed Stories Management Process

### File Structure Organization

The project maintains a clear separation between active and completed work through dedicated documentation files:

- **`docs/project-management/PROJECT_BACKLOG.md`** - Contains ONLY active/pending stories
- **`docs/project-management/COMPLETED_STORIES.md`** - Archives all completed stories with completion metadata
- **`docs/development/METHODOLOGY.md`** - Contains story point methodology and sizing philosophy
- **Main `README.md`** - Contains current project status and testing coverage information

### Completed Stories Workflow

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL**: Before making any backlog changes, follow the comprehensive safety procedures in [`BACKLOG_MANAGEMENT_PROCESS.md`](../project-management/BACKLOG_MANAGEMENT_PROCESS.md) to prevent story loss.

ü§ñ **FOR AI ASSISTANTS**: When any story is marked complete, ALWAYS reference this checklist and ask for confirmation before proceeding. Never add completed stories to PROJECT_BACKLOG.md under any circumstances.

üõ†Ô∏è **TEST VERIFICATION TOOL**: Use `scripts/tests/story-completion-test-check.sh <service-name>` to verify all tests pass before marking stories complete. This script is MANDATORY for any story affecting code.

When a story is marked as completed, follow this standardized process:

#### 1. Story Completion Verification
- Verify all acceptance criteria have been met
- Confirm definition of done is satisfied
- Validate any testing requirements are complete
- Ensure documentation updates are included

#### 2. Story Migration Process
- **Move** the completed story from `PROJECT_BACKLOG.md` to `COMPLETED_STORIES.md`
- **Update** the story with completion date (`**Completed:** YYYY-MM-DD`)
- **Mark** all acceptance criteria as completed with checkmarks (‚úÖ)
- **Add** business impact summary to the completed story
- **Remove** the story entirely from the backlog file

#### 3. Documentation Updates
- **Update** the summary section in `COMPLETED_STORIES.md` with new totals:
  - Total completed story points
  - Completion date range
  - Story count updates
- **Update** the main `README.md` with any status changes
- **Keep** `PROJECT_BACKLOG.md` focused only on active work

#### 4. Content Organization Rules
- **PROJECT_BACKLOG.md** should contain ONLY active stories (no methodology, no project status)
- **Project status information** belongs in `README.md`
- **Methodology and best practices** belong in `docs/development/METHODOLOGY.md`
- **Testing coverage details** belong in `README.md` under development status
- **Completed story archive** belongs exclusively in `COMPLETED_STORIES.md`

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Story Completion Checklist

**BEFORE marking any story as completed, verify:**

üî¥ **MANDATORY TEST VERIFICATION (MUST BE FIRST):**
- [ ] **ALL TESTS PASSING**: Run `mvn test` for affected modules and verify 0 failures
- [ ] **COMPILATION SUCCESS**: Run `mvn compile` and verify no errors
- [ ] **TEST RESULTS DOCUMENTED**: Record actual test counts (X/Y tests passing)
- [ ] **NO FAILING TESTS EXCEPTION**: If ANY test fails, story CANNOT be marked complete

‚úÖ **File Structure Rules:**
- [ ] PROJECT_BACKLOG.md contains ONLY active/pending stories
- [ ] COMPLETED_STORIES.md contains ALL completed stories
- [ ] NO "Recently Completed" sections in PROJECT_BACKLOG.md
- [ ] NO completed stories mixed with active stories

‚úÖ **Story Migration Steps:**
- [ ] Story removed entirely from PROJECT_BACKLOG.md
- [ ] Story added to COMPLETED_STORIES.md with completion date
- [ ] All acceptance criteria marked with ‚úÖ
- [ ] Business impact summary added
- [ ] COMPLETED_STORIES.md summary updated with new totals

‚úÖ **Documentation Updates:**
- [ ] Total story points recalculated correctly
- [ ] Completion date range updated
- [ ] CLAUDE.md updated with achievement details

### Story Completion Template

When moving a story to completed status, use this format:

```markdown
### **STORY-ID: Story Title** ‚≠ê **PRIORITY-LEVEL** 
**Epic:** Epic Name
**Story Points:** X  
**Priority:** Priority Level  
**Dependencies:** None/List dependencies  
**Completed:** YYYY-MM-DD

**Context:**
Original story context...

**Location:** Code locations if applicable

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ First acceptance criterion (completed)
- ‚úÖ Second acceptance criterion (completed)
- ‚úÖ Third acceptance criterion (completed)

**Definition of Done:**
- ‚úÖ First done criterion (completed)
- ‚úÖ Second done criterion (completed)
- ‚úÖ Third done criterion (completed)

**Business Impact:** Summary of the business value delivered by completing this story.
```

### Project Manager Agent Guidelines

The project-manager agent should proactively:

1. **Monitor** active stories in PROJECT_BACKLOG.md for completion status
2. **Validate** completion criteria before moving stories
3. **Maintain** accurate story point totals and completion statistics
4. **Ensure** clean separation between active and completed work
5. **Update** all relevant documentation files during the completion process
6. **Preserve** story history and business impact information

### Quality Standards

- All completed stories must include business impact summaries
- Completion dates must be accurate and formatted consistently (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Story point totals must be recalculated accurately
- Active backlog must remain focused and actionable
- No incomplete or in-progress stories should exist in COMPLETED_STORIES.md

### Benefits of This Process

- **Clear Separation**: Active vs completed work is immediately apparent
- **Progress Tracking**: Easy calculation of velocity and completion metrics
- **Business Value**: Completed stories document value delivered
- **Backlog Focus**: Active backlog remains actionable and current
- **Historical Record**: Complete project history preserved in completed stories
