# Documentation Organization Plan

## Current Issues

The docs directory has files in root that should be categorized:
- Docker-related docs in root (should be in deployment or development)
- Development workflow docs mixed with project management
- No clear structure for new developers

## Proposed Structure

```
docs/
├── README.md                          # Hub - links to all docs

## Migration Actions

### 1. Create New Directories
- `docs/getting-started/`
- `docs/architecture/`
- `docs/archive/`

### 2. Move Files

#### To `docs/getting-started/`:
- `docs/QUICK_REFERENCE.md` → `docs/getting-started/QUICK_REFERENCE.md`

#### To `docs/development/`:
- `docs/DOCKER_DEVELOPMENT.md` → `docs/development/DOCKER_DEVELOPMENT.md`
- `docs/MAKE_VS_ALTERNATIVES.md` → `docs/development/MAKE_VS_ALTERNATIVES.md`

#### To `docs/deployment/`:
- `docs/DOCKER_IMPROVEMENTS_SUMMARY.md` → `docs/deployment/DOCKER_IMPROVEMENTS_SUMMARY.md`
- `docs/ENFORCEMENT_MECHANISMS.md` → `docs/deployment/ENFORCEMENT_MECHANISMS.md`

#### To `docs/architecture/`:
- `docs/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` → `docs/architecture/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`
- `docs/ENFORCEMENT_DIAGRAM.md` → `docs/architecture/ENFORCEMENT_DIAGRAM.md`

#### To `docs/archive/`:
- `docs/development/CLAUDE.md` → `docs/archive/CLAUDE.md` (superseded by root CLAUDE.md)
- `docs/development/CONTEXT_ASSEMBLY_ERROR_ANALYSIS.md` → `docs/archive/`
- `docs/development/GATEWAY_TESTING_GUIDELINES.md` → `docs/archive/`
- `docs/development/KAFKA_ERROR_HANDLING.md` → `docs/archive/` (if not actively used)
- `docs/SCRIPT_SPECIFICATIONS.md` → `docs/archive/`

### 3. Update Root docs/README.md

Create a comprehensive hub that links to all documentation.

### 4. Update References

Update all files that reference moved documents:
- Root README.md
- CONTRIBUTING.md
- Root CLAUDE.md
- Other docs with cross-references

## Benefits

1. **Clear Entry Point**: New developers start at `docs/getting-started/`
2. **Logical Grouping**: Related docs together
3. **Reduced Clutter**: Archive old/deprecated docs
4. **Scalability**: Easy to add new docs to appropriate section
5. **Discoverability**: Hub README makes everything findable

## Implementation Order

1. ✅ Create new directories
2. ✅ Move files
3. ✅ Update docs/README.md hub
4. ✅ Update cross-references
5. ✅ Update root documentation (README, CONTRIBUTING, CLAUDE.md)
6. ✅ Test all links
