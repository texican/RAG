## 🔍 **Why QUALITY_STANDARDS.md Stayed in Root**

**Decision**: Keep `QUALITY_STANDARDS.md` in root directory

**Reasons**:
1. **High Visibility**: Quality is a top team priority
2. **Quick Reference**: Developers need quick access to standards
3. **Onboarding**: New team members see quality requirements immediately
4. **Convention**: Many projects keep standards/guidelines in root
5. **Small File**: Only 1 file, doesn't clutter root

**Alternative**: Could move to `docs/development/QUALITY_STANDARDS.md` if team prefers

---

## 📋 **File Organization Guidelines Going Forward**

### **Keep in Root**
- ✅ `README.md` - Always
- ✅ `BACKLOG.md` - Active work tracking
- ✅ `QUALITY_STANDARDS.md` - Team decision (currently in root)
- ✅ `LICENSE` - If/when added
- ✅ `CONTRIBUTING.md` - If/when added

### **Move to docs/**
- ⚠️ Technical specifications → `docs/development/`
- ⚠️ Sprint plans → `docs/project-management/`
- ⚠️ Test reports → `docs/testing/`
- ⚠️ Deployment guides → `docs/deployment/`
- ⚠️ API documentation → `docs/api/`
- ⚠️ Maintenance reports → `docs/project-management/`
- ⚠️ Historical documents → `docs/project-management/archive/` (if needed)

### **Optional Future**
1. Consider adding `CONTRIBUTING.md` to root
2. Consider adding `LICENSE` to root (if/when decided)
3. Consider creating `docs/project-management/archive/` for old reports
4. Consider moving `QUALITY_STANDARDS.md` to `docs/` if team prefers
