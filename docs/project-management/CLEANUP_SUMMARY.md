- ✅ Deleted all `.DS_Store` files (macOS system files)
  - Removed from root directory
  - Removed from `specs/` directory
  - Removed from `.claude/` directory
  - Removed from `docs/` directory

### **2. Cleaned Log Files**
- ✅ Removed all log files from root `logs/` directory
  - Deleted `rag-admin-service.log`
  - Deleted `rag-auth-service.log`
  - Deleted `rag-core-service.log`
  - Deleted `rag-document-service.log`
  - Deleted `rag-embedding-service.log`
  - Deleted `rag-gateway.log`
  - Deleted `setup.log`

- ✅ Cleaned all service-specific log directories
  - `rag-admin-service/logs/` - cleaned
  - `rag-core-service/logs/` - cleaned
  - `rag-embedding-service/logs/` - cleaned
  - `rag-gateway/logs/` - cleaned

### **3. Enhanced .gitignore**
Added new exclusions to prevent future clutter:
```gitignore
# Test results
/tmp/*-test-results.txt

# Backup directories
backups/

# Service logs
rag-*/logs/*.log
rag-*/logs/*.gz
```

### **4. Organized Documentation**
- ✅ Created `docs/testing/` directory
- ✅ Moved `TEST_RESULTS_SUMMARY.md` to `docs/testing/`
- ✅ Created comprehensive `docs/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`

### **5. Preserved Empty Directories**
Created `.gitkeep` files in:
- `logs/` - centralized log directory
- `rag-*/logs/` - service-specific log directories
- `rag-document-service/test-storage/` - test file storage

## 🎯 **Benefits of Cleanup**

### **1. Improved Git Repository**
- Removed tracked files that should be gitignored
- Cleaner git status output
- Smaller repository size
- No more macOS `.DS_Store` pollution

### **2. Better Organization**
- Test results in proper location (`docs/testing/`)
- Clear documentation structure
- Empty directories preserved with `.gitkeep`
- Logical file grouping

### **3. Enhanced Developer Experience**
- Easier to find documentation
- Clearer project structure
- Better navigation
- Professional organization

### **4. Maintenance Ready**
- Automated cleanup via `.gitignore`
- Log rotation won't pollute git
- Backup directories automatically excluded
- Test artifacts properly managed

---

## 📋 **File Relocations**

| Original Location | New Location | Reason |
|-------------------|--------------|--------|
| `TEST_RESULTS_SUMMARY.md` | `docs/testing/TEST_RESULTS_SUMMARY.md` | Better organization |
| N/A | `docs/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` | New comprehensive structure doc |
| N/A | `.gitkeep` files in log dirs | Preserve empty directories |

---

## 🔧 **Updated .gitignore Rules**

### **Added Exclusions**
```gitignore
# Test results - now only temp files excluded
/tmp/*-test-results.txt

# Backup directories - keep these private
backups/

# Service logs - prevent log pollution
rag-*/logs/*.log
rag-*/logs/*.gz
```

### **What's Now Gitignored**
✅ `.DS_Store` files (already was)
✅ `*.log` files (already was)
✅ `logs/` directory (already was)
✅ Backup directories (NEW)
✅ Service log files (NEW - explicit)
✅ Temp test results (NEW)
✅ `.env` files (already was)

### **What's Now Tracked**
✅ `docs/testing/TEST_RESULTS_SUMMARY.md` (moved from root)
✅ `docs/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` (new comprehensive doc)
✅ `.gitkeep` files (to preserve directory structure)

---

## 📊 **Before vs After**

### **Before Cleanup**
```
❌ 4 .DS_Store files tracked
❌ 7 log files in root logs/
❌ Multiple service log files
❌ Test results in root directory
❌ No structure documentation
❌ Empty directories not preserved
```

### **After Cleanup**
```
✅ 0 .DS_Store files (all deleted)
✅ Clean logs directory (with .gitkeep)
✅ All service logs cleaned
✅ Test results properly organized
✅ Comprehensive structure documentation
✅ Empty directories preserved
✅ Enhanced .gitignore rules
```

## 🚀 **Next Steps for Developers**

### **Going Forward**
1. **Logs**: Service logs will accumulate but won't be committed (gitignored)
2. **Test Results**: Will be generated in `docs/testing/` and tracked
3. **Backups**: Will go to `backups/` and be gitignored
4. **Structure**: Refer to `docs/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` for navigation

### **Best Practices**
- Don't manually create files in `logs/` - let services create them
- Test results should go in `docs/testing/`
- Use `scripts/` for any automation needs
- Document structure changes in `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`
