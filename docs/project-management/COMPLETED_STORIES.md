## Completed Stories

### **VECTOR-001: Implement Production Vector Search Infrastructure** ⭐ **CRITICAL** 
**Epic:** Core Search Infrastructure  
**Story Points:** 13  
**Priority:** High (Core functionality)  
**Dependencies:** None  
**Completed:** 2025-09-08

**Context:**
Core vector search functionality is currently mocked and needs proper implementation with Redis Stack or dedicated vector database for production-grade similarity search.

**Location:** `rag-core-service/src/main/java/com/byo/rag/core/service/VectorSearchService.java:57,66,71`

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ Replace mock `performVectorSearch()` with actual Redis Stack RediSearch implementation
- ✅ Implement `indexDocumentVectors()` for proper vector indexing 
- ✅ Add `isVectorSearchAvailable()` health check with Redis connectivity validation
- ✅ Configure vector similarity search with cosine similarity scoring
- ✅ Add performance benchmarks for vector operations

**Definition of Done:**
- ✅ Redis Stack RediSearch integration implemented
- ✅ Vector indexing functionality working
- ✅ Health checks for vector search availability
- ✅ Performance benchmarks established for search operations

**Business Impact:** Enables production-grade vector similarity search with Redis integration, forming the foundation for intelligent document retrieval.

### **CORE-TEST-001: Complete Core Service Test Infrastructure** ⭐ **CRITICAL**
**Epic:** Testing Infrastructure  
**Story Points:** 5  
**Priority:** High (Quality assurance)  
**Dependencies:** None  
**Completed:** 2025-09-08

**Context:**
Core service unit tests were failing (8/8 failing) due to incomplete test setup and mocking configuration, blocking deployment confidence.

**Location:** `rag-core-service/src/test/java/com/byo/rag/core/service/VectorSearchServiceTest.java`

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ All core service unit tests passing (8/8 success rate)
- ✅ Proper test isolation with comprehensive mocking
- ✅ Error scenario coverage with exception testing
- ✅ Performance test benchmarks for critical operations
- ✅ Documentation of test setup and maintenance procedures

**Definition of Done:**
- ✅ 100% core service unit test success rate achieved
- ✅ Best practices applied per TESTING_BEST_PRACTICES.md
- ✅ Comprehensive test documentation with clear test scenarios
- ✅ Continuous integration compatibility verified

**Business Impact:** Ensures reliable deployment of core RAG functionality with comprehensive test coverage, enabling confident production releases.
