## üìã **BACKLOG MANAGEMENT**

### **Backlog Prioritization Rules**
1. **CRITICAL**: Production blockers - must be resolved first
2. **HIGH**: Enterprise-grade quality requirements  
3. **MEDIUM**: Core functionality completion
4. **LOW**: Enhancements and optimization
5. **DEBT**: Technical debt and maintenance

### **Story Point Estimation Guide**
- **1-2 points**: Simple bug fixes, small configuration changes
- **3-5 points**: Medium complexity features, test additions
- **8 points**: Complex features, major refactoring
- **13 points**: Large features, comprehensive test suites
- **21+ points**: Epic-sized work, may need breakdown

### **Definition of Ready (Stories)**
- [ ] Acceptance criteria clearly defined
- [ ] Dependencies identified
- [ ] Technical approach outlined
- [ ] Effort estimated
- [ ] Quality validation requirements specified

### **Definition of Done (Stories)**
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Unit tests passing (100%)
- [ ] Integration tests passing (100%)  
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Quality gate validation passed: `./scripts/quality/validate-system.sh`
- [ ] Documentation updated

## üö® **RISK MITIGATION**

### **High Risk Items**
1. **Integration Test Complexity**: May require more effort than estimated
   - *Mitigation*: Allocate buffer time, consider technical spikes
2. **Database Relationship Issues**: May have deeper architectural problems
   - *Mitigation*: Early investigation, potential architecture review
3. **E2E Test Infrastructure**: Complex setup with multiple services
   - *Mitigation*: Incremental approach, Docker Compose validation

### **Contingency Plans**
- **Sprint Overrun**: Reduce scope, move lower priority items to next sprint
- **Blocking Issues**: Escalate immediately, consider parallel work streams
- **Quality Gate Failures**: Stop feature work, focus on quality resolution

**Next Actions**: 
1. Review and approve sprint plan
2. Assign stories to team members  
3. Create GitHub issues using `./scripts/backlog/create-github-issues.py`
4. Begin Sprint 1 execution with daily standups and progress tracking
