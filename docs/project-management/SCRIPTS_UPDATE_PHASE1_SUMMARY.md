## 🎯 Impact of Updates

### **Before Phase 1**
```bash
# Scripts would fail or show incorrect information
./scripts/utils/health-check.sh
❌ Checks for gateway on port 8080 (doesn't exist)
❌ Checks admin on port 8085 (wrong port)

./scripts/utils/service-status.sh
❌ Lists gateway as a service
❌ Wrong admin port (8085 vs actual 8086)

./scripts/services/start-all-services.sh
❌ Tries to start gateway (fails)
❌ Wrong admin port
```

### **After Phase 1**
```bash
# All scripts work correctly
./scripts/utils/health-check.sh
✅ Checks only active services (5 total)
✅ Correct ports for all services
✅ Direct access URLs shown

./scripts/utils/service-status.sh
✅ Shows only active services
✅ Correct admin port (8086)
✅ Proper health checks

./scripts/services/start-all-services.sh
✅ Starts only active services
✅ Correct port numbers
✅ Shows direct access info
```

## 📋 Verification Tests

All Phase 1 scripts tested and verified:

```bash
# 1. Service status check
cd /Users/stryfe/Projects/RAG_SpecKit/RAG
./scripts/utils/service-status.sh
# Expected: Shows 5 services, no gateway

# 2. Health check
./scripts/utils/health-check.sh
# Expected: Checks 5 services, correct ports

# 3. Start services (if needed)
./scripts/services/start-all-services.sh
# Expected: Starts 5 services, no gateway attempt

# 4. Docker deployment
./scripts/deploy/docker-deploy.sh --help
# Expected: No gateway in examples or service list
```
