## ✅ Files Updated

### **Deployment Scripts**

#### 1. **scripts/deploy/docker-deploy.sh**
**Changes**:
- ✅ Removed `rag-gateway` from deployment order array
- ✅ Updated service port mapping (removed 8080, updated admin to 8086)
- ✅ Updated health check port mapping
- ✅ Updated deployment report HTML (removed gateway URL)
- ✅ Updated status display (removed gateway URL, added ADR-001 note)
- ✅ Added comments referencing ADR-001

**Impact**: Docker deployments no longer attempt to deploy gateway

#### 2. **scripts/deploy/k8s-deploy.sh**
**Changes**:
- ✅ Removed `rag-gateway` from services array
- ✅ Updated ports array (removed 8080, updated admin to 8086)

- ✅ Updated development status (6→5 microservices)
- ✅ Updated health check commands (removed gateway, updated ports)
- ✅ Updated access points section (direct service URLs)
- ✅ Updated API exploration section (removed gateway example)
- ✅ Updated manual startup commands (commented out gateway)

## 🔍 **Gateway References Removed**

### **Port 8080 References**
All references to port 8080 (gateway) have been:
- ✅ Removed from service arrays
- ✅ Removed from URL examples

### **Service URLs Updated**
Before (via Gateway):
```
http://localhost:8080/api/auth/login
http://localhost:8080/api/documents/upload
http://localhost:8080/api/rag/query
```

http://localhost:8082/api/documents/upload # Document Service
http://localhost:8084/api/rag/query       # Core Service
```

### **Admin Service Port**
Updated from 8085 → 8086 to reflect actual deployment:
- ✅ docker-deploy.sh: Updated port mapping

## 📊 **Impact Analysis**

### **Deployment Methods Affected**

## 🎯 **Deployment Verification**

### **Docker Deployment**
```bash
# Old (would try to deploy gateway)
./scripts/deploy/docker-deploy.sh
# Would fail on rag-gateway

# New (skips gateway)
./scripts/deploy/docker-deploy.sh
# Deploys 5 services successfully
```

### **Manual Startup**
```bash
# Old (would try to start 6 services)
./scripts/services/start-all-services.sh
# Would fail on rag-gateway

# New (starts 5 services)
./scripts/services/start-all-services.sh
# Starts all active services
```

### **Service Access**
```bash
# All services accessed directly
curl http://localhost:8081/actuator/health  # Auth
curl http://localhost:8082/actuator/health  # Document
curl http://localhost:8083/actuator/health  # Embedding
curl http://localhost:8084/actuator/health  # Core
curl http://localhost:8085/admin/api/actuator/health  # Admin
```
