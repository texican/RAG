## Active Backlog Stories

### **AUTH-FIX-001: Fix Admin Service BCrypt Authentication Validation** ⭐ **CRITICAL BUG**
**Epic:** Authentication & Authorization Infrastructure  
**Story Points:** 8  
**Priority:** P0 - Critical (Blocking administrative operations)  
**Dependencies:** None

**Context:**
Admin service authentication endpoint consistently returns "Invalid credentials" for `admin@enterprise-rag.com` despite valid user, correct BCrypt hashes, and proper request format. This blocks all administrative functionality including tenant management, user administration, and system analytics.

**Problem Evidence:**
- ✅ User exists in database with ADMIN role and ACTIVE status
- ✅ Request validation passes (email format, password length)
- ✅ Service finds user in database queries successfully
- ❌ BCrypt password validation consistently fails
- ❌ Multiple valid BCrypt hashes tested without success

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Admin user `admin@enterprise-rag.com` authenticates with password `admin123`
- [ ] Authentication returns valid JWT token with ADMIN role claims
- [ ] JWT token works for accessing protected admin endpoints
- [ ] Authentication logging shows successful login without warnings
- [ ] BCrypt validation matches standard Spring Security implementation

**Technical Investigation Required:**
- [ ] Debug BCrypt configuration in admin service
- [ ] Investigate AdminAuthController password validation logic
- [ ] Check for BCryptPasswordEncoder bean configuration issues
- [ ] Verify Spring Security dependency versions
- [ ] Add debug logging for authentication flow

**Definition of Done:**
- [ ] Admin authentication works for existing credentials
- [ ] All admin endpoints accessible with generated JWT tokens
- [ ] Unit and integration tests pass
- [ ] Authentication performance <500ms
- [ ] Security audit confirms no vulnerabilities introduced

**Business Impact:**
**CRITICAL** - Completely blocks administrative operations, tenant management, system oversight, and production readiness.

**Current Workarounds:**
- Use Document Service Swagger UI (public access): http://localhost:8082/swagger-ui.html
- Individual service Swagger UIs with generated passwords
- Direct database operations for urgent admin tasks
