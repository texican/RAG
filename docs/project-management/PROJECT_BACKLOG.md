# BYO RAG System - Task Backlog

### **ERROR-001: Implement Kafka Error Handling and Retry Logic** ⭐ **CRITICAL**
**Epic:** System Reliability  
**Story Points:** 8  
**Priority:** High (System reliability)  
**Dependencies:** None

**Context:**
Embedding service Kafka consumers lack proper error handling, which could lead to lost document processing requests and system instability.

**Location:** `rag-embedding-service/src/main/java/com/byo/rag/embedding/service/EmbeddingKafkaService.java:71`

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Implement retry mechanism with exponential backoff for failed embedding operations
- Add failure notification system to alert administrators of persistent failures
- Create dead letter queue for messages that consistently fail processing
- Add comprehensive logging for failure scenarios with context
- Implement circuit breaker pattern for downstream service failures

**Definition of Done:**
- Test coverage added for error scenarios and retry mechanisms
- Documentation updated with new error handling capabilities
- All existing functionality continues to work unchanged
- Performance benchmarks showing error handling doesn't degrade normal operation

**Business Impact:**
This directly addresses system reliability gaps that could cause document processing failures in production environments.

### **KAFKA-001: Implement Comprehensive Kafka Integration** ⭐ **CRITICAL**
**Epic:** Message Infrastructure  
**Story Points:** 8  
**Priority:** High (Core functionality)  
**Dependencies:** None

**Context:**
Current Kafka integration is incomplete with basic producer/consumer setup but missing enterprise-grade features like proper error handling, monitoring, and dead letter queues.

**Location:** Multiple services have placeholder Kafka configurations

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Implement robust error handling with retry mechanisms for all Kafka operations
- Add comprehensive monitoring and alerting for message processing health
- Set up dead letter queues for failed message processing scenarios
- Create proper topic management and partitioning strategies
- Add message serialization/deserialization with schema validation

**Definition of Done:**
- All services properly integrated with Kafka message bus
- Error handling tested with failure scenario simulations
- Monitoring dashboards showing message throughput and error rates
- Documentation covering Kafka architecture and troubleshooting
- Performance benchmarks under various load conditions

**Business Impact:**
Essential for reliable asynchronous processing of document uploads and embeddings in production environments.

### **SECURITY-001: Implement Advanced Security Features** ⭐ **CRITICAL**
**Epic:** Security Infrastructure  
**Story Points:** 13  
**Priority:** High (Security)  
**Dependencies:** None

**Context:**
Current JWT-based authentication needs enhancement with advanced security features like rate limiting, request validation, and audit logging for enterprise deployment.

**Location:** `rag-gateway/src/main/java/com/byo/rag/gateway/filter/JwtAuthenticationFilter.java`

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Implement rate limiting to prevent API abuse and DDoS attacks
- Add comprehensive request validation and sanitization
- Create detailed audit logging for all authentication and authorization events
- Implement session management with proper token refresh mechanisms
- Add CORS configuration for secure cross-origin requests

**Definition of Done:**
- Security testing performed with penetration testing scenarios
- Rate limiting tested under high load conditions
- Audit logs properly formatted and stored securely
- OWASP security best practices implemented and verified
- Documentation of all security features and configuration options

**Business Impact:**
Critical for enterprise deployment where security compliance and threat protection are mandatory requirements.
