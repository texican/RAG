## Active Backlog Stories

### **AUTH-FIX-001: Fix Admin Service BCrypt Authentication Validation** ✅ **COMPLETED**
**Epic:** Authentication & Authorization Infrastructure  
**Story Points:** 8  
**Priority:** P0 - Critical (Blocking administrative operations)  
**Dependencies:** None

**Context:**
Admin service authentication endpoint consistently returns "Invalid credentials" for `admin@enterprise-rag.com` despite valid user, correct BCrypt hashes, and proper request format. This blocked all administrative functionality including tenant management, user administration, and system analytics.

**Resolution Summary:**
- ✅ **Root Cause Identified**: Database contained incorrect BCrypt hash for admin user
- ✅ **Solution Implemented**: Updated password_hash with verified working BCrypt hash `$2a$10$4ruqE8FlnERNCuIW/6pI6.1rlZmJiG/plwFwif5KPGxjwbM9Sm6je`
- ✅ **Scripts Updated**: Fixed admin email in test scripts from `admin@enterprise.com` to `admin@enterprise-rag.com`
- ✅ **Validation Complete**: All integration tests passing, admin authentication fully functional

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Admin user `admin@enterprise-rag.com` authenticates with password `admin123`
- [x] Authentication returns valid JWT token with ADMIN role claims
- [x] JWT token works for accessing protected admin endpoints
- [x] Authentication logging shows successful login without warnings
- [x] BCrypt validation matches standard Spring Security implementation

**Definition of Done:**
- [x] Admin authentication works for existing credentials
- [x] All admin endpoints accessible with generated JWT tokens
- [x] Unit and integration tests pass
- [x] Authentication performance <500ms
- [x] Security audit confirms no vulnerabilities introduced

**Business Impact:**
**RESOLVED** - Admin operations, tenant management, and system oversight fully operational.

**Completion Date:** 2025-09-29

### **DOCKER-HEALTH-011: Fix Admin Service Docker Health Check Configuration**
**Epic:** Deployment & Infrastructure  
**Story Points:** 3  
**Priority:** Low (Cosmetic Issue)  
**Dependencies:** None

**Context:**
The `rag-admin` container shows as "unhealthy" in Docker status despite the service being fully functional. The Docker health check is configured to check `/actuator/health`, but the admin service actually serves its health endpoint at `/admin/api/actuator/health` due to the service's context path configuration.

**Problem Evidence:**
- ❌ Docker health check: `http://localhost:8085/actuator/health` → Returns 404 Not Found
- ✅ Actual health endpoint: `http://localhost:8085/admin/api/actuator/health` → Returns 200 OK
- ✅ Service functionality: 100% operational, all integration tests pass
- ❌ Container status: Shows as "unhealthy" in `docker ps` and docker-compose health checks

**Current Impact:**
- **Functional Impact**: NONE - Service works perfectly
- **Visual Impact**: Container appears unhealthy in Docker tooling
- **Monitoring Impact**: May trigger false alerts in production monitoring

**Root Cause:**
Dockerfile health check configuration uses wrong endpoint path:
```dockerfile
# Current (incorrect)
HEALTHCHECK CMD wget --spider http://localhost:8085/actuator/health

# Should be
HEALTHCHECK CMD wget --spider http://localhost:8085/admin/api/actuator/health
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Docker health check uses correct endpoint `/admin/api/actuator/health`
- [ ] `rag-admin` container shows as "healthy" in `docker ps`
- [ ] Health check passes without affecting service functionality
- [ ] Docker compose health status shows GREEN for admin service
- [ ] No regression in actual service operation

**Technical Tasks:**
- [ ] Update Dockerfile health check endpoint path
- [ ] Rebuild admin service Docker image with corrected health check
- [ ] Test health check with manual verification
- [ ] Update docker-compose configuration if needed
- [ ] Verify no Docker build cache issues interfere with deployment

**Definition of Done:**
- [ ] Admin service container shows as "healthy" in Docker status
- [ ] Health check endpoint returns successful HTTP 200 response
- [ ] Service functionality remains 100% operational
- [ ] Documentation updated with correct health check configuration
- [ ] No false negative health alerts in monitoring

**Business Impact:**
**LOW** - Cosmetic issue that doesn't affect functionality but improves operational visibility and prevents false monitoring alerts.

**Current Status:**
Service is fully functional despite health check display issue. This is a maintenance/polish task for improved operational experience.

### **GATEWAY-CSRF-012: Fix Gateway CSRF Authentication Blocking**
**Epic:** Deployment & Infrastructure  
**Story Points:** 8  
**Priority:** Medium (Operational Enhancement)  
**Dependencies:** None

**Context:**
The API Gateway has persistent CSRF protection that prevents authentication requests to `/api/auth/login` despite multiple attempts to disable CSRF in the security configuration. This blocks Swagger UI authentication and requires users to access services directly instead of through the unified gateway.

**Problem Evidence:**
- ❌ Gateway auth endpoint: `POST /api/auth/login` → Returns "An expected CSRF token cannot be found" (HTTP 403)
- ✅ Direct auth service: `POST localhost:8081/api/v1/auth/login` → Returns valid JWT tokens (HTTP 200)
- ❌ Spring Security auto-configuration overriding custom security configuration
- ❌ Multiple security filter chains causing configuration conflicts

**Root Cause Analysis:**
Spring Boot's reactive security auto-configuration is creating default security filter chains that take precedence over custom `SecurityWebFilterChain` configuration, despite:
- Custom `@Order(HIGHEST_PRECEDENCE)` security configuration
- Explicit CSRF disable: `.csrf(ServerHttpSecurity.CsrfSpec::disable)`
- Auto-configuration exclusions for `ReactiveSecurityAutoConfiguration`
- Application properties: `spring.security.csrf.enabled: false`

**Current Impact:**
- **Functional**: Minimal - All services work via direct access
- **User Experience**: Users must use individual service Swagger UIs instead of unified gateway
- **Development**: Requires knowledge of individual service ports and endpoints
- **Monitoring**: Bypasses centralized gateway metrics and logging

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Gateway accepts POST requests to `/api/auth/login` without CSRF token
- [ ] Gateway Swagger UI authentication works with admin credentials
- [ ] Gateway auth endpoint returns valid JWT tokens (matching direct auth service)
- [ ] No regression in security for protected endpoints
- [ ] Gateway properly forwards authentication requests to Auth Service

**Technical Investigation Required:**
- [ ] Complete Spring Security filter chain analysis and mapping
- [ ] Identify conflicting security configurations in Spring Cloud Gateway
- [ ] Research Gateway-specific security configuration patterns
- [ ] Evaluate custom authentication filter implementation approach
- [ ] Consider WebFlux security configuration alternatives

**Technical Approaches to Explore:**
1. **Complete Security Auto-Configuration Bypass**: Remove all Spring Security and implement custom filters
2. **Gateway-Specific Security Configuration**: Use Spring Cloud Gateway security patterns
3. **Custom Authentication Filter**: Implement gateway-level authentication without Spring Security
4. **Profile-Based Configuration**: Isolate security configuration by deployment profile
5. **WebFlux Security Pattern Review**: Ensure reactive security best practices

**Definition of Done:**
- [ ] Gateway authentication endpoint accessible via curl and Swagger UI
- [ ] Authentication flow: Gateway → Auth Service → JWT token return
- [ ] No CSRF errors for authentication endpoints
- [ ] Security maintained for all other protected endpoints  
- [ ] Integration tests pass with Gateway authentication
- [ ] Documentation updated with Gateway authentication examples

**Business Impact:**
**MEDIUM** - Improves developer experience and operational consistency by enabling unified gateway access. Not critical for functionality but important for production operational experience.

**Alternative Workarounds Available:**
- Direct service access: `http://localhost:8081/api/v1/auth/login` (fully functional)
- Individual service Swagger UIs work correctly
- API testing tools (Postman, curl) work with direct endpoints
