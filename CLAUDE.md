# CLAUDE.md - Enterprise RAG System

## 🎯 Project Overview

You are helping build a **production-ready Enterprise RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) system** - a sophisticated AI platform that demonstrates both advanced backend engineering and cutting-edge AI integration skills.

This is a **portfolio project** designed to showcase senior-level backend development capabilities combined with modern AI/ML engineering practices.

## 🏗️ Architecture & Technology Stack

### Core Architecture
- **Multi-tenant microservices** with complete data isolation
- **Event-driven processing** using Apache Kafka
- **Vector database operations** with Redis Stack
- **Hybrid search** combining semantic and keyword search
- **Production monitoring** with Prometheus/Grafana

### Technology Stack
```yaml
Backend Framework: Spring Boot 3.2+ with Spring AI
Language: Java 21 (latest LTS)
AI/ML Libraries: Spring AI, LangChain4j, HuggingFace Transformers
Vector Database: Redis Stack with RediSearch
Primary Database: PostgreSQL with pgvector
Message Queue: Apache Kafka
Caching: Redis (separate from vector storage)
Monitoring: Micrometer, Prometheus, Grafana
Testing: JUnit 5, Testcontainers, WireMock
Deployment: Docker, Kubernetes, Helm
```

### Development Tools
- Use git jj for source control
